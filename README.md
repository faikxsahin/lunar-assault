# Lunar Assault (In Progress)

Lunar Assault is a sci-fi 3D arcade flight game. The Planet Luna is under attack and it is your mission to save it! The main goal is to get from starting area to end without crashing to the enemies or environment. There is also a scoreboard at the bottom left corner of the screen which increases based on the enemy's type.

This is the most challenging game I have ever developed till today. I had faced various problems but it was a great experience to solve them. I have a better understanding of problem solving. Also, this project made me understand Unity Asset implementation which made a great impact on how the game looks. Even though it was difficult to develop, I enjoyed the the process very much. I felt the game keeps evolving as I added new features. When I was a kid, I used to go to local Arcade and play games like these. (I still play games like this btw :D) So, developing an arcade flight game means a lot to me. I am very satisfied with the final look of the project.

I learned and experimented many new Unity terms and features:
* Adding, texturing and manipulating the Terrain.
* Unity Terrain Tools.
* Unity Asset Store implementaition and licence types.
* Adding Master Timeline for Player Rail.
* Animating Enemies using Timeline.
* Using GetAxis() for Player Movement. (Unity's new Input System but preferred old)
* Using Mathf.Clamp() to constrain the movement.
* Setting Local Rotation to Player with Position and Throw.
* Builded a Particle System for shooting Lasers. (Setting up firing input)
* Understanding and using Nested Prefabs.
* Using Arrays and Foreach loop.
* Using Header and Tooltips attributes.
* Better understanding of Collisions and Triggers.
* Reloading the Scene after Collision.
* Better understanding of the Particle Effects.
* Instantiating Prefabs at Runtime.
* Better understanding of Public Methods in C#.
* Adding simple interface for displaying score.
* Tips and tricks on setting up Enemy Prefabs and Enemy Hit Points.
* Using FindWithTag() method.
* Controlling tracks on Timeline for Enemy Waves.
* Using Singleton Pattern for Music Player.
* Using Skybox and Lightning features.
* How to do simple Post Processing.

A great point of view :)

## Resources

1. [Star Sparrow Sci-Fi Modular Spaceship by Ebal Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/star-sparrow-sci-fi-modular-spaceship-73167) for the Player's Spaceship and also Enemy Ships. I highly recommend this asset for various spaceship models.
2. [Skybox Volume 2 (Nebula) by Hedgehog Team](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-volume-2-nebula-3392) for Skybox's view and it completely changed the game's atmosphere. It looks very cool!
3. I used [Rob Tuytel's Snow Texture 3](https://polyhaven.com/a/snow_03) and [Amal Kumar's Gravel Stones](https://polyhaven.com/a/gravel_stones) for the terrain. I think they are pretty great textures for snowy or planet environments.
