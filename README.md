# Lunar Assault (In Progress)

Lunar Assault is a sci-fi 3D arcade flight game. The main goal is to get from starting area to end without crashing to the enemies or environment. There is also a scoreboard at the bottom left corner of the screen which increases based on the enemy's type.

This is the most challenging game I have ever developed till today. I had faced various problems but it was a great experience to solve them. I have a better understanding of problem solving. Also, this project made me understand Unity Asset implementation which made a great impact on how the game looks. Even though it was difficult to develop, I enjoyed the the process very much. I felt the game keeps evolving as I added new features. When I was a kid, I used to go to local Arcade and play games like these. (I still play games like this btw :D) So, developing an arcade flight game means a lot to me. I am very satisfied with the final look of the project.

I learned and experimented many new Unity terms and features:
* Adding, texturing and manipulating the Terrain.
* Unity Terrain Tools.
* Unity Asset Store implementaition and licence types.
* Adding Master Timeline for Player Rail.
* Animating Enemies using Timeline.
* Using GetAxis() for Player Movement. (Unity's new Input System but preferred old)
* Using Mathf.Clamp() to constrain the movement.
* Setting Local Rotation to Player with Position and Throw.
* Builded a Particle System for shooting Lasers. (Setting up firing input)
* Understanding and using Nested Prefabs.
* Using Arrays and Foreach loop.
* Using Header and Tooltips attributes.
* Better understanding of Collisions and Triggers.
* Reloading the Scene after Collision.
* Better understanding of the Particle Effects.
* Instantiating Prefabs at Runtime.
* Better understanding of Public Methods in C#.
* Adding simple interface for displaying score.
* Tips and tricks on setting up Enemy Prefabs and Enemy Hit Points.
* Using FindWithTag() method.
* Controlling tracks on Timeline for Enemy Waves.
* Using Singleton Pattern for Music Player.
* Using Skybox and Lightning features.
* How to do simple Post Processing.
